By finding the best fit value of all points, you can easily map your inputs and outputs.

For example, if you are looking for the price of a car based on how many miles it has, we can create a relationship x as the number of
miles in the odometer and y as the price. With a bunch of these values, we can plot them into an x,y plane and by getting the best fit
value, you can find the likelyhood of what the price of your car will be given the number of miles.

There are many ways to get the best fit line, but in this assignment, we used the gradient descent method.
