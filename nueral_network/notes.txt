In this assignment, we are creating a simple neural network that mimicks how to the brain works.

To create a nueral network, we must first start with inputs and outputs. Let A be our inputs while b be our outputs.

A = [[0, 0, 1], 
	 [1, 0, 1], 
	 [1, 0, 0]]

b = [[0],
	 [0], 
	 [1]]

What we do next, is we try to solve for the system by first creating random weights from -1 to 1. Then we update the weights until we get a minimum error. Since we iterate through the equations 10,000 times, we are likely to get a very small error and we can output our results.
